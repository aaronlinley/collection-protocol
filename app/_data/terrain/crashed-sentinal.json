    "description": "The mutant-hunting creations of Doctor Bolivar Trask, the Sentinels are towering robotic enemies of all mutant-kind. While they are technologically advanced and possess advanced energy weapons, the ability to fly, and sensors designed to track down mutants, they are not indestructible. Working together, a team can overpower and destroy these enormous machines.\nBut the Sentinels learn from every engagement. With each confrontation, they learn and adapt their tactics for future battles. Terminate one Sentinel—terminate one thousand—it makes no difference. Their numbers are too great.\nEnhance the battlefield with the Crashed Sentinel Terrain Pack. Whether your crisis takes place in the modern day or the far-flung days of a future past, the detailed wreck of this metal giant is a perfect addition to your games of Marvel: Crisis Protocol.",
