    "description": "In addition to being a brilliant scientific mind and ace freelance photographer, Peter Parker is the amazing Spider-Man, a hero who gained incredible superpowers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Swinging through the streets of New York on his web lines and wall-crawling his way to the scene of a crisis, Spider-Man arrives just in time to stop the plots of his nefarious foe: Doctor Otto Octavius! The man now known as Doctor Octopus was once a driven, ingenious researcher who graduated from M.I.T. at the top of his class.
