    "description": "As a world-renowned nuclear physicist, Otto Octavius invented his signature robotic arms to assist with his scientific research. Octavius's life was forever changed after an accident fused his robotic appendages to his body. His mind fundamentally altered by the accident, Octavius found he was able to psychically control the mechanical limbs as if they were his own flesh and blood. But the strain of this transformation changed the good doctor, and he soon turned to a life of crime as Doctor Octopus. Since then, “Doc Ock” has been one of Spider-Man's greatest foes, and the wallcrawler has proven to be a significant thorn in Octavius's side. Though he prefers to work alone, Doctor Octopus has often sought out allies when the need arises. Whatever the circumstances, Doc Ock only values his teammates insofar as they help him further his own goals.",
