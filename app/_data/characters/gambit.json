    "description": "Remy LeBeau is Gambit, a dashing scoundrel with the mutant power to accelerate the molecular energy of an object, transforming mundane items into kinetically-charged explosives. Raised by a gang of New Orleans street thieves, Gambit is a master thief and former member of the Thieves' Guild. Forced into the employ of the Marauders, Gambit had an unwitting hand in the destruction of the Morlocks. Wracked by guilt, his life of wandering ended when he met Storm and him finding a new family as one of the X-Men. Now fighting to protect others, he dishes out punishment with his bo staff and trademark playing cards. With a little kinetic enhancement, Gambit always has the winning hand.",
