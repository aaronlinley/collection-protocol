    "description": "Born with a power that is both blessing and curse, the mutant Rogue can absorb the powers and memories of anyone she touches. This remarkable but devastating power allows her to wield the abilities of her foes but leaves them depletedâ€” or worse. Prolonged contact with her skin drains the vital energy from those she touches. Afraid to harm those close to her, Rogue fled her past life. A runaway from the American South, she started her career as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants under Mystique before joining the X-Men to fight on the side of good.",
