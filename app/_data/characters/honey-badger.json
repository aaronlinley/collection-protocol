    "description": "Alchemax Genetics created Gabrielle Kinney from the building blocks of X-23's genetic makeup. She was trained by Alchemax to serve as a bodyguard and elite fighter who possessed the same regenerative ability as Laura Kinney and Wolverine, as well as retractable bone claws. Her creators further enhanced her to be impervious to pain through an Alchemax nanite therapy, a painful process that shortened the lifespan of its subjects. She ultimately broke free from her cruel makers in Alchemax with the aid of her rebellious sisters and assumed the identity of Honey Badger as a member of the X-Men.",
