    "description": "A cowardly young man, Bob was persuaded to join the criminal organization Hydra by his wife, who accused him of not being able to hold down a steady job. The thought of a stable career with a dental plan also appealed to Bob, though he was ultimately disappointed to find out that Hydra does not, in fact, offer full dental like A.I.M. Bob's life was forever changed when he met Deadpool during the Merc with a Mouth's assault on his outpost. Deadpool convinced Bob to assist him with his mission and the two became lifelong partners. These days the H on Bob's chest no longer stands for Hydra but Hero!",
