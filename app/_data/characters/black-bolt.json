    "description": "Blackagar Boltagon, known as Black Bolt, is the king of the Inhumans, a strain of humans genetically engineered by the Kree Empire to be living weapons. With his voice, Black Bolt harnesses immense power. When he speaks, he can produce a shockwave able to level a whole city. Even a whisper from Black Bolt renders his enemies feeble and broken. He has endured rigorous conditioning to control this power, choosing to remain totally silent. Only in defense of his people does Black Bolt unleash the power of his destructive voice.",
