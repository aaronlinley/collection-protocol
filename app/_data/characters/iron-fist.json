Fueled by a desire for revenge, Danny traveled to the mystical city of K'un-Lun. There, he trained under Lei Kung the Thunderer who turned him into a living weapon. As a final test, Danny challenged the dragon Shou-Lao and defeated him. Plunging his fist into the dragon's molten heart, Danny became the bearer of the Iron Fist.
