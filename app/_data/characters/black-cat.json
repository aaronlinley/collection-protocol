    "description": "Felicia Hardy is a world-renowned cat burglar with the latent ability to manipulate probability, causing her enemies to suffer unpredictable luck. After a chance encounter with Spider-Man, Felicia gave up a life of lawbreaking (well, mostly) to become a crimefighter. Despite an on-again, off-again romance with Spider-Man, she remains one of his closest allies, occasionally even giving up large scores in order to do the right thing. Felicia Hardy is the Black Cat, and the odds have a way of always landing in her favor.",
