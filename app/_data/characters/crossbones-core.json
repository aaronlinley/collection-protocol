    "description": "Going by the name Crossbones, the mercenary and thug Brock Rumlow is as brutal as they come. Trained by both the combat virtuoso Taskmaster and the Red Skull himself, Crossbones is not an opponent to be taken lightly. His extreme physical training and intensive mental conditioning allow him to shrug off even the most powerful blows while giving him the strength and skill necessary to go toe to toe with, and even overcome, super-enhanced opponents.",
