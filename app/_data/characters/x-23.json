She was born to be a living weapon and had minimal human contact to enhance her savage and killer instincts. X-23 is a peerless fighter and assassin with all the mutant abilities of Wolverine, including a superhuman ability to heal from any injury, lightning-fast reflexes, and retractable adamantium-coated claws in her hands and feet.",
