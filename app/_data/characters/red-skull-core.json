    "description": "Johann Schmidt rose to power during World War II, eventually taking control of the villainous organization Hydra, and has become one of Earth's most dangerous threats as the Red Skull. Possessing similar superhuman strength, agility, and reflexes as Captain America, the Red Skull also boasts genius-level intellect and a cunning strategic mind. His greatest asset, however, is the Cosmic Cube, a relic of untold power. At its full potential, the Cosmic Cube grants its bearer the ability to literally reshape reality according to their whim.",
