    "description": "Firstborn of Odin and Freyja, Angela was kidnapped by Heven during the war between Heven and Asgard. Thought dead by her parents, Angela was raised and trained to be one of Heven's deadliest hunters and warriors. Having learned of her true parentage, Angela cast aside her loyalty to Heven and to Odin, choosing to serve no master but her own conscience. She now travels the cosmos fighting against any evil which dares crosses her path, both alongside her brother Thor, and as part of the Guardians of the Galaxy.",
